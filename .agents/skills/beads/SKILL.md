name: beads
description: Use when working in a repository that uses bd or Beads for durable project task tracking, issue dependencies, blocker management, multi-session handoff, or shared work memory. Trigger when the user asks to find ready work, claim or close tasks, create follow-up work, inspect blockers, recover project context, or choose between local planning and persistent project tracking.

# Beads

Use Beads as the shared project task system. Local plans, scratch files, and personal memories are useful, but they are not the durable source of truth for project work.

## First Step

```bash
bd prime
bd where
```

## Core CLI Workflow

```bash
bd ready                        # Find work
bd list --status=open           # List open work
bd show <id>                    # Inspect
bd update <id> --claim          # Claim
bd create "Title" --description="Why" --type=task --priority=2  # Create follow-up
bd close <id> --reason="Completed"  # Close
```

## What Belongs In Beads

Use Beads for:

- shared project tasks
- blockers and dependencies
- discovered follow-up work
- work that must survive thread reset, compaction, or handoff
- status that another person or agent should be able to resume

Use agent-local planning tools only for the current turn's execution checklist. Do not treat them as shared project state.

## Rules

- Do not create markdown TODO files as the source of truth when Beads is available.
- Do not use `bd edit`; it opens an interactive editor. Use `bd update` flags instead.
- Prefer `--json` when parsing `bd` output programmatically.
- If hooks are installed, `bd prime` may already be injected. Run it manually when context is missing.
- Do not auto-close or mutate tasks unless the work is actually complete.
