# archied changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-27

- feat: add the Telegram gateway with persistent sessions, topic-thread support, streamed rich replies, typing indicators, and Markdown rendering
- feat: add `/spawn`, `/approve`, and `/cancel` for chat-driven task control
- feat: provide a comprehensive `/help` guide whose command list stays aligned with Telegram's published menu and Archie's executable command surface
- feat: add `/provider` and provider-filtered `/model` selectors that switch the provider and model used by subsequent live chat turns
- feat: include the active provider and full model reference in `/status`
- feat: notify authorized Telegram users once when a newly tagged component release is installed
- feat: add `/restart` to reload and relaunch the Telegram gateway without interrupting in-flight daemon tasks
- feat: add deny-by-default Telegram sender authorization and native command-menu publication
- feat: connect Desktop Commander through Archie's managed MCP client so chat can use workspace file and process tools
- feat: add multi-identity daemon configuration, persona routing, an email channel, and webhook platform support
- feat: add NellDB-backed task, session, message, and memory persistence
- feat: add memory synchronization, prefetch, context scrubbing, threat scanning, and built-in memory tools
- feat: add tool guardrails, classification, budgets, availability filtering, and disclosure controls
- feat: add feature-based YAML configuration with `conf.d` overlay loading
- feat: add typed secret-engine registration and Yaegi extension support
- fix: reject unknown slash commands locally instead of allowing the LLM to fabricate command behavior
- fix: publish Telegram commands to default, private-chat, and group-chat scopes so stale commands inherited with the bot token cannot shadow Archie's menu
- fix: drain the SDK's full event stream so streamed Telegram replies cannot deadlock
- fix: use standard newline-delimited JSON framing for MCP stdio clients
- fix: make MCP stdio shutdown and timeout handling race-safe
- fix: restore legacy `[forge].token_env` compatibility and required container environment passthrough
- fix: make the agent-container Docker network explicitly configurable
